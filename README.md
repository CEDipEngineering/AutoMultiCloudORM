# AutoMultiCloudORM

Python boto3 scripts to automatically deploy multi-instance, multi-cloud, RESTful ORM

ORM used is a custom-made simple Flask application available here: https://github.com/CEDipEngineering/basic-orm-example

This deployment uses MySQL as a database, operating on the default 3306 port. Flask operates on the default port (5000) as well.
